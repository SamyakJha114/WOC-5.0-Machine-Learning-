THIS FOLDER CONTAINS THE CODES WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF N- LAYER  NEURAL NETWORK USED AS MULTICLASS CLASSIFICATION  AND THE OUTPUT CSV FOR THE CLASSIFICATION TEST DATASET
The file Neural_Network(without optimizers) is the file with n-layer implementation of neural network with Batch Gradient Descent and withour any optimizers 
The file Neural_NEtwork(Final_attempt) is the file with n - layer implementation of neural network with mini - Batch Gradient Descent and with Adam's Optimizer
